[x] Debug Spyder debugger. Getting caught up on first line and unable to use debugging. ((BLOCKER))
	+ As of 17 FEB 2022, working on PyCharm. Will create a new Conda Environment to test.
	+ Confirmed working on 11 MAR 2022. No clue what happened.
		= Issue was qtconsole version. Had similar issue on a different device. Fixed.
	+ Completed 15 MAR 2022.
	+ As of 02 MAR 2022, working on a separate computer. Unsure why this issue arose.

[x] Create redundancy for collection alongside Zenserp. Zenserp client for Google news search stopped working ((BLOCKER))
	+ Completed 16 FEB 2022. Zenserp fixed the API issue but I implemented a catch clause just in case.

[ ] Create ETL scripts within MySQL to pre-process the data. This is likely more efficient than running in Python.

[ ] Update the .yml. Some dependency conflicts present.

[ ] Create trend analytics method. Trend score, average searches, etc.
	+ Code finalized on 23 FEB 2022. Need to integrate with the DB.

[ ] Publish code to a cloud-based server so the code can run without daily intervention.
	+ 03 MAR 2022. Considering AWS Lightsail. Either containerize the app or, if possible, build it in Cloudsail.
	+ 21 MAR 2022. Investigating EC2. I know I can schedule EC2 launches. If I can schedule daily launches at 0830,
	  then, presumably, I can schedule EC2 to run my code at 0830 every morning even if my computer is off. let's say,
	  EC2 launches at 0800. At 0830 the code runs. By 0900 the EC2 instance stops running. However, I believe I still
	  may need to interact with the instance to run my code..

[ ] Implement data cleaning and processing methods.
	+ Started 15 MAR 2022

[ ] Create logging methods and logging DB table.

[ ] Create scoring methods and scoring DB table.

[ ] Train multivariate TS models.

[ ] Create webapp/web interface.
